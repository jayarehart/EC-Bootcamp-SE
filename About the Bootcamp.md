# Day 1
Day One of the bootcamp will focus on ensuring all attendees are fluent in the language of embodied carbon. Through a combination of lecture-style instruction and interactive workshops, attendees will learn the fundamentals of embodied carbon and best practices for incorporating embodied carbon measurement and reduction strategies into their designs. The afternoon consists of a workshop to apply what was learned in the morning to one of your own projects.

# Day 2
Day Two of the bootcamp will bring attendees up to speed with the latest best practices for addressing embodied carbon as a structural engineer. Presentation topics will include design strategies, engaging with architects and contractors, insights into the upcoming SEI Prestandard, an overview of building codes and legislation, and discussions on SE 2050.
