As structural engineers, we should lead the discussion of embodied carbon related to the structural system.

The structural engineer is the most well-equipped to make reductions, so if they are not involved in the embodied carbon conversation, these efficiencies may not be realized.

**Structural engineers can:**
- Include embodied carbon as part of their service offerings.
- Ask to be part of the sustainability charrette on projects.
- Be highly knowledgeable about the embodied carbon of structural systems.
- Be willing to educate the rest of the design team.

# What to do, when?
The following is adapted from the [CLF Road Map to Reducing Building Life Cycle Impacts](https://carbonleadershipforum.org/lca-practice-guide/).

For each of the design stages, the following actions are recommended to be taken by the structural engineer in collaboration with the entire design team.
## Pre-Design
- Set whole-building carbon intensity limits, % reductions, and/or limits.
- Identify what green building rating systems may be targeted.
## Schematic Design
- Identify the structural system goals and carbon reductions
- Work with geotechnical engineer to optimize foundation options.
- Study structural system comparisons and suitability for design.
- Discuss how design decisions will impact schedule and budget with the contractor.
- Refine structural performance criteria considering serviceability requirements and loading.
## Design Development
- Identify “hot spots” of the structural system (e.g. topping slab, mat foundations) as areas to refine.
- Collaborate to reduce the volume of structural materials as much as possible.
- Finalize reduction strategies for the structural system (e.g. cement reduction, sourcing goals for steel).

## Construction Documents
- Confirm reduction strategies are achievable with contactor and suppliers.
- Identify GWP limits for materials
- Include embodied carbon specific specifications to ensure material-specific reductions are achieved and are part of the bid requirements.

## Construction
- Update final calculations based upon as-built submittals.
- Confirm that reduction targets have been met.

# Presenting Results
Without effectively sharing the results of embodied carbon assessments, there is little value in performing the assessment in the first place. Some things to consider when presenting results:
- **Simplification**: how can key results be communicated effectively?
- **Storytelling**: identify how design decisions made by others will impact other systems.
- **Levers**: emphasizing the levers available to reduce structural embodied carbon, and their relative magnitudes, is key to enabling conversation.
