# SE 2050
Guidance has been prepared by the SE 2050 Committee and can be found here: [Specification Guidance](https://se2050.org/resources-overview/structural-materials/specification-guidance/).

These specifications were written and prepared by the Resources Working Group of the SE 2050 Committee and reviewed by industry representatives. The suggestions presented provide a framework to build from.

The specification guidance includes whole building strategies and is organized by structural material.
## CLF Model Embodied Carbon Specifications
The Carbon Leadership Forum (CLF) has also published [Model Embodied Carbon Specifications](https://carbonleadershipforum.org/es_mx/model-embodied-carbon-specifications/) that can be customized and built upon. These model specifications support the Buy Clean, Buy Fair legislation in Washington State.

Structural materials such as ready mix concrete, precast concrete, rebar, hot-rolled structural steel, metal deck, glulam, CLT/DLT/NLT (and many more), are all included.

Additional *Division 1 - Sustainable Design Requirements*  model specifications are also included.
# AISC Sustainability Toolkit for Designers
AISC has put together a number of resources for designers related to sustainability into a toolkit: [Sustainability Toolkit for Designers](https://www.aisc.org/sustainability-toolbox/sustainability-designer-toolkit/). Included is a resource on "Specification Strategies for Embodied Carbon Reduction"
# Performance Based Design Concrete Specification
The NCSEA Sustainable Design Committee has developed guidance for a performance-based concrete specification: [Performance-Based Concrete Specification Guidance: Concrete Class Table](https://www.ncsea.com/app/uploads/2024/09/NCSEA-Sustainable-Design-Committee-Performance-Based-Concrete_V1.0.pdf) in addition to an informational list of relevant concrete properties.
