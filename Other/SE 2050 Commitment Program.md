# About
The Structural Engineering 2050 (SE 2050) Commitment Program is a firm-based commitment program, which aims to reach net-zero embodied carbon emissions from structural systems by 2050. The program is sponsored by the Structural Engineering Institute (SEI) and is managed by an SEI technical committee. It engages structural engineering firms with the basic aims of education, engagement, reporting and advocacy.
# History
The SE 2050 commitment program is a response to the SE 2050 Challenge that was issued in 2019 by the Carbon Leadership Forum (CLF). You can read more about the [original challenge](https://carbonleadershipforum.org/se-2050-challenge/).
