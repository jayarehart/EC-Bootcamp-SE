The Construction Association (AGC) has published a [Decarbonization and Carbon Reporting Playbook](https://www.agc.org/climate-change-playbook) that outlines guidance for contractors for tracking transportation (A4) and construction (A5) emissions. Emissions calculators are also made available.

While accounting for the A4 and A5 emissions can be a challenge for the structural engineer, especially in the design, this playboook can be shared with contractors as an education tool.
