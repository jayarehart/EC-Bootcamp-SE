While in the [[Example Embodied Carbon Calculation]], we explored how to calculate cradle-to-gate (A1-A3) embodied carbon of structural systems, there is much more to consider when calculating the embodied carbon of other life cycle modules.

The IstructE's [How to calculate embodied carbon](https://www.istructe.org/resources/guidance/how-to-calculate-embodied-carbon/) (2nd edition) is a good starting resource (and is free to download).
