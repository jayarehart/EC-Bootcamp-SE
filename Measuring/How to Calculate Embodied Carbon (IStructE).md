In the [[Example Embodied Carbon Calculation]], we explore how to calculate cradle-to-gate (A1-A3) embodied carbon of a structural system. It is also important to consider other life cycle modules.

The IstructE's [How to calculate embodied carbon](https://www.istructe.org/resources/guidance/how-to-calculate-embodied-carbon/) (2nd edition) is a good starting resource (and is free to download).

In the future, a North American-specific prestandard will be published by ASCE / SEI to provide guidance for practicing structural engineers in the US: [[Prestandard for Assessing the Embodied Carbon of Structural Systems for Buildings]]
