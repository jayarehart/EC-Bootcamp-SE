Welcome to a resource page dedicated to introducing structural engineers to embodied carbon.

This resource is put together to supplement the annual [Embodied Carbon Bootcamp for Structural Engineers](https://www.colorado.edu/ceae/embodied-carbon-bootcampsymposium-structural-engineers) event: [[About the Bootcamp]]

You may have found your way here as a past attendee, somebody shared it with you, or a search engine brought you here. Regardless, welcome!

If you have suggestions, edits, fixes, improvements to make to any of the pages within, or things you'd like to see, please reach out to [Jay Arehart](mailto:jay.arehart@colorado.edu) (jay.arehart@colorado.edu).
