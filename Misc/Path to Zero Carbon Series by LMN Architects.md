Architecture firm, LMN, has penned a long series called [Path to Zero Carbon](https://lmnarchitects.com/lmn-research/path-to-zero-carbon-series) that describes how to design *true* zero-carbon buildings. These articles are well-crafted, collaborative with leaders in the industry, in addition to being peer-reviewed. They present a wealth of knowledge on the topic of zero-carbon buildings.

While the focus of the series goes beyond the scope structural engineers, there are plenty of good resources and a great thing to share with those new to the topics.

Articles of note for the structural engineer are articles: [10 – Existing Building Reuse](https://lmnarchitects.com/lmn-research/10-existing-building-reuse) and [11 – Structure: Steel, Concrete + Wood](https://lmnarchitects.com/lmn-research/11-structure-steel-concrete-wood).
