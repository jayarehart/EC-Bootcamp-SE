# SEI Towards Zero Carbon 2024 Workshop Report
From July 22–24, 2024, over 100 experts from across the architecture, engineering, and construction industries convened at Northeastern University to develop a roadmap guiding the structural engineering profession toward zero embodied carbon by 2050.
### Strategic Roadmap
SEI will lead the structural engineering profession toward zero carbon by 2050 through a structured roadmap, performance standards, and integration of sustainability into core design practices.
### Innovation & Risk Reduction
The profession must de-risk adoption of low-carbon materials and systems via protocols, demonstration projects, and education, while promoting reuse and circular economy principles.
### Policy & Advocacy
SEI will advocate for embodied carbon standards in building codes, collaborate with federal agencies, and launch public awareness campaigns to elevate the role of structural engineers in climate action.

A full list list of (30) priority initiatives were brought forward and prioritized by a vote. See the final report for a full list.

# SE 2050 Strategic Plan
  The SE 2050 Strategic Plan is structured around five core focus areas (Operations, Community, Data, Education, and Advocacy) each with clearly defined objectives, current actions, and near-term (1–5 year) deliverables. For example:
## Operations
- Objective: Establish operational structure that will allow the program to run to at least 2050.
- Planned Near-Term (3-5 years) Actions: Identify a strategy for funding sources to ensure the long-term financial solvency of the program, which may include a combination of grants, donations, and direct revenue streams from sales of products or events.
## Data
- Objective: Chart a path towards net zero carbon structural systems by 2050.
- Key Current Action (1/9): Develop framework to include structural material quantity reporting requirements in new database to address material efficiency.
## Advocacy
- Objective: Promote the important role of structural engineers in achieving wider buildings industry net zero goals.
- Key Current Action (1/5): Engage with local structural engineering organizations (e.g., local SEI chapters, local NCSEA chapters).

# SE 2050 Database Report

SE 2050 Database [Report](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/book/10.1061/9780784485927) and [Executive Summary](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/epdf/10.1061/9780784485927.fm)

- Key Findings: Gross floor area showed the strongest correlation with total embodied carbon (GWP), while other influential factors included structural system type, building use, and typical floor live load.
- Preliminary “Upper-Bound” Benchmark: A preliminary upper limit of 350 kg CO₂e/m² for upfront structural embodied carbon (A1–A5 stages) is proposed, based on the 80th percentile of current data.
- Data Limitations: The analysis dataset (522 projects) lacks sufficient quality and consistency to establish precise benchmarks, highlighting the need for improved data collection and standardization. Commentary: as of 2025, the Program now has +1,500 projects and updates to this study are already in progress.
- Actionable Recommendations: Prioritize early collaboration with the project architect and consider embodied carbon in structural system selection. SE 2050 will continue to enhance data granularity and guidance for future submissions.

# Low Carbon Concrete Guide
[Low Carbon Concrete Guide](https://lowercarbonconcrete.org/guide)

The guide provides practical strategies for reducing the embodied carbon of concrete (8% of global GHG emissions and majority of building embodied carbon) through performance-based specifications, GWP benchmarks, and informed procurement practices.

- GWP Benchmarks & Thresholds should be set based on realistic, location-specific GWP benchmarks and project-level thresholds using EPDs and tools like [EC3](https://www.buildingtransparency.org/) and [NRMCA](https://www.nrmca.org/association-resources/sustainability/) calculators. Benchmark data should move towards benchmarks based on strength and material placement.
- Specification & Testing: Performance-based specifications and robust testing protocols to validate lower-carbon concrete mixtures without compromising structural performance. Key testing flow chart provided in Figure 1.
- Material Readiness: The guide differentiates between novel, pilot-ready, market-ready, and project-ready concretes.
- Implementation Tools: Includes sample specification language ([NCSEA](https://www.ncsea.com/app/uploads/2024/09/NCSEA-Sustainable-Design-Committee-Performance-Based-Concrete_V1.0.pdf)), testing standards, and bid leveling templates to support adoption, collaboration, and accountability throughout the project.
